# hackbi-vi-github

## Get Started :
GitBash for windows, although this can be installed somewhat easily. Mac and Linux should already have a form of Git.



## Uses: (How does it apply in daily uses?)
It allows people to contribute to coding projects effectively. It is essentially a very fancy version of google docs but for code.


## Purpose: (Why choose your workshop?)
To learn an effective way to code collaboratively.


## Goal: 
Give people a general overview of GitHub and its uses, as well as basic Git commands.


## Challenges:
* Installation of Git and GitHub
* Overview of application
* Repository demos
* Repository challenges


## Resources/Sites Used:
The Github website give a lot of guidance, but my workshop will be very structured which should make it easier to take over if need be.
